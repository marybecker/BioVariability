Significant progress has been made to clean up rivers since the passage of the Federal Clean Water Act in 1972. However, much of the focus has been on fixing waste-receiving streams with overt pollution problems which has left high quality streams vulnerable and open to degradation. This project seeks to demonstrate progress made to date, while at the same time highlighting the need to modernize assessment methods to identify high quality streams and continue to augment the success of the Clean Water Act.  

Biological condition gradient (BCG) tiers and metrics have been developed for macroinvertebrate communities in Connecticut.  Effective use of a tiered based framework offers tremendous advantages to better identify high quality streams and set more attainable expectations for other water bodies.    In this project, we explore and visualize (https://marybecker.github.io/Biointegrity/) the variability in macroinvertebrate metrics and assemblage data over the past 30 years.  This exploration helps to gain a better understanding of the changes that have occurred at managed vs. sentinel monitoring sites over the period of record, and helps to disassociate changes due to ‘natural’ phenomena from that caused by anthropogenic stressors.  With this understanding we can better utilize BCG tiers and metrics to identify high quality waters and provide insight into how to enhance tiered-based assessment needed to better protect high quality waters from degradation in Connecticut.
